# udacity_repo
I have created this repo to store some of the course projects and training material that I am learning from "Machine LEarning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree"
Task 1: list git commands
1. git clone - used to create a local copy of the remote repository
2. git branch - used to create, list and delete branches
3. git checkout - used to switch between branches
4. git add - used to stage changes for commit
5. git commit - used to save changes to the local repository
6. git push - used to upload all commits to a local repository
